In short, it can be moved to allow the passage for boats or ships. The bridge design incorporates an integrated hydraulic system into the bridge in order to carry more weight.
                                                This type of bridge is presently thier in Rameshwaram named "pamban bridge".

This type of bridge can be used in emergency situations. In this system the footpaths of bridge are fitted with hydraulic system that will allow the footpaths of bridge to move up and down. If thier is a heavy traffic on the bridge, if any ambulance got struck in bridge then the footpath of bridge comes the level of road and allows the traffic to move through this footpath.
                                                Then automatically the ambulance comes out off the traffic.

Canal lining is the process of reducing seepage loss of irrigation water by adding an impermeable layer to the edges of the trench. Seepage can result in losses of 30 to 50 percent of irrigation water from canals, so adding lining can make irrigation systems more efficient.</p>

                                        Innovative project idea focused on implementing a Smart Agriculture Crop Management Godown. A Farmer should have knowledge about the condition of their agricultural crops. Farmers are keeping their agricultural crops in warehouses to increase the lifetime of food grains. Reports suggests that almost fifty proportion of the food made world-wide doesn't even reach the individuals as they're wasted throughout harvest, transportation, or storage. One in all the point that threats to the farmers is that the loss throughout storage of crops in granaries and warehouses. If crop losses are reduced, it'll mechanically increase the number of food accessibility. 
                                        To solve this problem one solution is that This project includes smart warehouse management and monitoring farming field, which includes temperature maintenance, humidity maintenance, fire alarms, stock measurement, Pest control. To assist and help the farmers who protects crops by storing in warehouse, a fully automated enabled observation system is planned to be deployed in remote areas wherever the accessibility is incredibly minimum for farmers with smart storage facilities to scale back food losses and increase food safety..

                                            <p>Most of the emergency hospital ambulances are equipped with paramedics, even though they are unable to reach the incident site because of huge traffic at junctions. Once the ambulance got struck in traffic, it takes more time to reach the incident and it is obvious what happens to the patient till the ambulance reaches? Due to slow movement of traffic the ambulance cannot reach the hospital at right time and leads to death of the patient. 
                                                In order to overcome this problem developing a working detector model for emergency vehicle detection in traffic signals, which will detect the vehicle and the signal at the junction comes to green and allow the traffic to flow in that direction, after the vehicles moves the signal at that point will works as usual.

                                            This system uses ARDUINO controller based embedded system to process real time data collected using the vibration sensor and IR sensor. Whenever robbery occurs vibration sensor is used here which senses vibration and sounds will occur from the buzzer and through IOT it sends a message to the police station and to the corresponding bank, motor of the door automatically closes to easy catch the theft. Buzzer will activate to alert surrounding people, dc motor also closed to catch that person. All input and output modules are interfaced to ARDUINO Microcontroller which process input data and provide output with help of 5V regulated power supply.</p>
